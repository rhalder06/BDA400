Final Exam
-----------------
1) Data visualizations are used to (check all that apply):

4) Using the notebook backend, you can modify a figure after it is rendered.
True

5) The scripting layer is (check all that apply)
- comprised mainly of pyplot.
- lighter that the Artist layer, and is intended for scientists whose goal is to perform quick exploratory analysis.

- Titles
- Tick Lables
- Images

7) There are three types of Artist objects.
False

8) Each primitive artist may contain other composite artists as well as primitive artists.
False

9) Given a pandas dataframe, question, which of the following will create a horizontal barchart of the data in question?
question.plot(kind='barh')

True

11) What do the letters in the box plot above represent?
A = Median, B = Third Quartile, C = First Quartile, D = Inter Quartile Range, E = Minimum, and F = Outliers

12) What is the correct combination of function and parameter to create a box plot in Matplotlib?
Function = plot, and Parameter = kind, with value = "box"
